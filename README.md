# Encryption and Decryption Project

This Python script demonstrates encryption and decryption using:
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for symmetric encryption.
- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** for asymmetric encryption.

## Features
- AES in CBC mode with key derivation.
- RSA encryption with public/private keys.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dan-BaN/Data-Encryption-and-Decryption-Module.git
   cd Data-Encryption-and-Decryption-Module

OR 

2. Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python encryption_decryption.py
